# üíÖ React-table front-end coding challenge with github actions

This will have interaction with the table like filtering and sorting

### üéÅ Installing dependencies

This project uses `yarn`.
You can run the following command to install all dependencies.

```sh
yarn install
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Running the dev server

To see what you're building run the following command:

```sh
yarn start
```

It will start the dev-server and open a page in your default browser.

### üß™ Testing

This project uses [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) as a test runner.
The tests are written using [`@testing-library/react`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).
Also, we have enhanced the `expects` with [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) to give you some more explicit assertions.

You can run all tests with the following command:

```sh
yarn test
```

### üì¶ Example data

Since there is no backend in this exercise all data comes from `./src/data.json`.

## üîç Things to notice in the app-

- folder structure update
- number of rows at the end of the table to know the count
- documentation throughout the code
- styling with scss
- meaningful test cases
- initial sort in number column
- shuffeling between ascending and descending sorting
- debounce filter input
- filter the "%s" column, can be seen by 4 types(substring match, exact string match, fuzzy match, faceting)
- imported provided svg icon to display sorting in the column header
- fix date sort column
- adjusted in built filter features and added new as per the requirements in the test cases(no number min max input, and just one search box, with custom filter method)
- dark theme
- analysis on library selection

\*very beautiful, but heavy, and might have features which are not needed, poor documentation

Reason behind react table library selection-

- no styling is there- headless ui, will not intervene in branding
- super fast
- lightweight
- opensource, well maintained, free
- most popular -> big community -> big support in terms of collabarators

helpful links other than npm and github for selecting the library-

- https://npmcompare.com/compare/react-data-grid,react-table,slickgrid
- https://npmtrends.com/ag-grid-vs-react-data-grid-vs-react-table-vs-react-virtualized

## Improvements that can be done-

- write more test cases
- typescript
- responsive and styling
- debug mode- environment specific. on, when development mode. off, when production mode.
